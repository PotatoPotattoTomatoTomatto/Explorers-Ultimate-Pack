# Known Bugs

-The pipe thingy connecting the nozzle of the Courage engine to the attachment point doesn’t gimbal

-The Grid Fin can't be deployed in the build screen

-Solar Panels and RTG's automatically shut down when all batteries have been filled

-In the build menu, the mass of the Xenon in the tank is less than it displays

-If any batteries on the ship have less than 100% electricity, then solar panels don't play an animation while closing

-The RTG's power output has weird connections to throttle

-Cargo Bay starts off opened in the build menu and plays a closing animation once placed, rather than being closed the whole time

-Part's don't adapt to service bay
